# School-Project
This is a simple terminal ascii renderer for a school project. It has support for rendering:
* circles (smooth and non-smooth)
* rectangles
* lines

The project also contains an example that takes in a .jpg filepath and renders out the picture in ascii, as well as one with a pulsing cube and finally also a bouncing ball.
