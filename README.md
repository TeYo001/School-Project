# School-Project
This is a simple terminal ascii renderer for a school project. It has support for rendering:
* circles (smooth and non-smooth)
* rectangles
* lines

The project also contains an example that takes in a .jpg filepath and renders out the picture in ascii, as well as one with a pulsing cube and finally also a bouncing ball.
To run the examples, simple run '''python3 Examples.py''' in your terminal (remember that you might need to resize the font size of your terminal to be able to view the rendered examples, which can usually be done with Ctrl+ or Ctrl-)

## Installation
This project can simply be cloned with git. You will need to install imageio however, which can be downloaded with the following command: '''pip install imageio'''
